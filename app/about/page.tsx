      <h1>About this log</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>Behind the Build is a public decision log written from inside uncertainty.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        It exists for moments when you are building or promoting something,
        taking action, making choices — while not knowing whether any of it will work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Writing decisions down for others is intentional.
        Explaining a decision clearly is often the only way to understand it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most entries start from a negative question:
        <em> what would guarantee getting lost here?</em>
        If that alone is enough to orient the next step, the thinking stops.
      </p>

      <p>
        Decisions are written in the moment they are made.
        They are not edited later to match outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Signals — or the absence of signals — create new constraints.
        New constraints justify new decisions.
        Earlier decisions are revisited through new entries, not rewritten.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, patterns may emerge.
        Not because they were planned, but because decisions accumulated.
      </p>

      <p>
        This log exists to stay oriented while shouting into the void —
        together with others who are doing the same.
      </p>
